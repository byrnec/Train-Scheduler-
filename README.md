## Purpose of the game
This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 

This will retrieve and manipulate the information entered with Moment.js. 

At the bottom, this website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
